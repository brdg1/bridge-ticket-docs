# Privacy Policy – Bridge Ticket Bot

**Last Updated:** November 4, 2025  

---

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **Bridge Ticket Bot** (“the Bot”, “we”, “us”, “our”).  
We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your data while providing a secure and transparent ticket management experience within the **Bridge Community Network**.

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how it is processed, stored, and protected, and the rights you have regarding your data when interacting with Bridge Ticket Bot.

By using the Bot, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

---

## 2. Scope
This Privacy Policy applies exclusively to the operation of **Bridge Ticket Bot** within the **Bridge Community Network**, which includes:
- The **main community hub server**, and  
- Up to **three officially designated sub-category servers**.

The Bot is **not intended or authorized for use on any other Discord servers**.

---

## 3. Data We Collect
Bridge Ticket Bot collects and processes only the data necessary to operate its ticket management functions.  
The types of data collected include:

### 3.1 Automatically Collected Data
When you interact with the Bot:
- **Discord User ID** (of the ticket creator)  
- **Discord User ID** (of the assigned staff member)  
- **Timestamps** (ticket creation and closure times)  
- **Ticket content** (messages sent inside ticket channels)  
- **Ticket transcripts** (HTML format generated when a ticket closes)

### 3.2 Data Excluded from Collection
Bridge Ticket Bot **does not collect or display**:
- Server IDs  
- Channel IDs  
- Email addresses  
- IP addresses  
- Any other personal identifiers not directly provided by Discord’s API

---

## 4. Purpose of Data Processing
The data collected by Bridge Ticket Bot is used solely for the following purposes:

- **Ticket management:** Creating, handling, and closing user tickets.  
- **Moderation:** Allowing staff to review and manage community support requests.  
- **Transparency:** Generating transcripts for moderation and record-keeping.  
- **Automation:** Managing temporary roles and ticket statistics.  
- **Security:** Preventing abuse and ensuring accountability within the Bridge Community Network.

No data is ever sold, shared, or transferred to third parties for marketing, analytics, or any commercial purpose.

---

## 5. Data Storage and Security
All collected data (including ticket transcripts and logs) is stored securely on a **dedicated external Discord server** owned and operated by the **Bridge Ticket Bot development team** within the Bridge Community Network.  

Security measures include:
- Restricted access to authorized personnel only.  
- Role-based permissions on the external log server.  
- Automatic cleanup of inactive or deleted tickets.  
- Continuous monitoring to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

---

## 6. Data Retention
Bridge Ticket Bot retains data **only as long as necessary** for legitimate moderation and transparency purposes.

- Active ticket data exists temporarily within the active server.  
- When a ticket closes or expires:
  - The ticket and role are deleted from the main server.  
  - The transcript and emblem (record) are stored on the external log server.  
- When a user **declines** the disclaimer:
  - The ticket is deleted, but a minimal **log emblem** containing the user ID, staff ID, and timestamp is created — without server or channel identifiers.

We are currently developing a **controlled and accelerated data deletion system** to ensure that all stored data can be removed quickly and securely upon request or automatically after a defined retention period.

---

## 7. Legal Basis for Processing
Bridge Ticket Bot processes data based on the following legal grounds:

- **User Consent:** Users must accept the disclaimer before a ticket is created.  
- **Legitimate Interest:** For maintaining moderation logs, support transparency, and community safety within the Bridge Community Network.  
- **Compliance with Discord’s Terms of Service:** Data processing aligns with Discord’s API Terms and Privacy Policy.

---

## 8. User Consent
Before any data is processed, users must explicitly **accept the disclaimer** displayed by the Bot.  
By accepting, users acknowledge and agree to:
- The temporary processing of their ticket-related data.  
- The creation of an HTML transcript after ticket closure.  
- The limited storage of non-sensitive identifiers for transparency purposes.

If a user does **not** accept the disclaimer:
- The ticket is deleted immediately.  
- A log emblem (user ID, staff ID, timestamp) is still generated for moderation records — without server or channel identifiers.

---

## 9. Data Access and Control
Only authorized administrators and developers of the Bridge Ticket Bot team have access to ticket transcripts and log data.  
This access is strictly controlled and monitored to ensure user privacy and prevent misuse.

Users may:
- Request a copy of their stored ticket data.  
- Request deletion of their data (see Section 10).  
- Revoke their consent to further data processing by discontinuing use of the Bot.

---

## 10. Data Deletion Requests
Users may request that their data (ticket transcripts or log emblems) be deleted by contacting the development team.  
Requests will be reviewed and processed promptly, unless data retention is necessary for moderation or compliance purposes.
